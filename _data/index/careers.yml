              In the spring and fall semesters of 2017, I worked for US Bank for a
              total of eight months. During this time I worked on a team
              that employed the agile methodology to help improve and maintain
              US Bank's business-banking web application, Singlepoint.
              This involved working with HTML and CSS on the frontend, and
              a J2EE based backend that interfaced with a DB2 (SQL) database.
              This experience was incredibly valuable for me not only in
              furthering my technical experience, but mainly for me to
              learn about best professional practices when working on a
              large scale project alongside dozens of other developers.

              While working with Bridgeable, a small startup based in 
              Cincinnati, my duty was to be a flexible 
              and versatile front-end developer who would implement
              the website's mockups and designs, while also giving critical
              feedback and advice about what would be most valuable
              from a technical standpoint. My role as an intern was to
              begin development on the Bridgeable website (bridgeable.org)
              and to introduce GScript as a tool to more efficiently manage
              portions of Bridgeable's data.

              My first work experiences under the co-op program here at
              the University of Cincinnati were as a Java Developer at Siemens
              PLM Software. As a part of this experience, I worked on a testing
              harness to be used by testers on the QA team to write automated
              tests. This project involved studying existing test cases and then
              using Cucumber to provide testers with a near-english language
              for writing tests. We then worked to allow these tests to be
              executed in a browser without user intervention using Selenium.

              After following up on a professor's posting
              about helping with a research project, me and a peer
              were given the task of building a utility in Python that
              would allow my professor to easily pull and study Github
              repositories. By iteratively learning about his use cases
              and implementing functionality, over the semester, we were
              able to produce a program that would output a summary of the
              data corresponding to the specified set of commits.
              Additionally, this utility could optionally make a copy of 
              the repo's filesystem at each commit in a specified directory.
