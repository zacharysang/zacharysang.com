          A repo that I hope to fill with my tinkerings in prolog.
          I became very interested in this language and its approach
          to problem solving this past semester in a class about AI.

          Recently I have become very interested in Eclipse's che project.
          I see their approach of separating workspace configuration and
          tooling from code using Docker containers as incredibly powerful
          and useful. I really wanted to help out with this effort in some way
          so I have submitted a couple PRs that contribute to che's collection
          of recipes (recipes are used to define workspaces in che) and have
          also included this project here to spread the word!

          A python utility I made over christmas break to allow me to
          interactively copy files from one system to another by
          selecting extensions I was interested in keeping (Eg: keep .img
          and .docx files, but leave behind .metadata or .exe files)
